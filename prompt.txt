The Verilog RTL module for the microcode sequencer located at sources/instruction_decoder_2.v is failing simulation. 
The simulation fails at the testcase that generates random combination of inputs and the testcase that tests post reset behvaiour.

Debug and fix the RTL file based on the specification which is available at docs/Specification.md.
